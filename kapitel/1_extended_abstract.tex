\section{Introduction}

The \currentauthor{Marvin Böcker} \emph{suffix array} (\emph{SA}) is a widely known text index,
which can be used for various string operations,
like full-text search~\cite{makinen} and construction of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)~\cite{BWT}.
It is a permutation of all indices $1 \dots n$ of a text of length $n$ such
that the $i$th suffix of the text has lexicographic rank $\sa[i]$.

While the efficient construction is still an active research area,
divsufsort~\cite{saca:5,saca:5:repo} is the empirically fastest
suffix array construction algorithm (SACA) since 2008\todo{wann?},
even though it has a theoretical complexity of $\mathcal O (n \log n)$,
while there are some $\mathcal O(n)$ algorithms available.

For the last year we (re-)implemented eleven SACAs~\cite{saca:3,saca:11,saca:5,saca:9,saca:1,saca:8,saca:4,saca:7,saca:10,saca:6,saca:2}
in modern C++ in order to create faster and more memory efficient implementations,
and although our attempts were mostly not successful,
we created a sophisticated benchmark framework for SACA algorithms, \emph{SACABench}, in the process.

In this paper we introduce SACABench and highlight its features,
as well as document some of the optimiziation strategies we used to implement the SACA algorithms.

\section{Benchmark Tool}

SACABench is a CMake/C++14 project which contains many different SACA algorithms.
There are both sequential algorithms and parallel algorithms included
and we also include the reference implementations for all of the algorithms, if one exists.
You are able to run a single, a subset of, or all of the algorithms, depending on your needs.
Time and memory consumption is automatically measured and can be output as JSON.
We also include tools to convert the JSON-format to graphs for a visual comparison of the algorithms.
Most of the graphs in this paper have been generated using SACABench directly\todo{Is that so?}.

This is the most important aspect of our framework:
the possibility to easily run many SACAs on the same input text on the same hardware
in order to measure and compare them fairly.

\subsection{Running a single algorithm}

You can evaluate a single algorithm with the command \termfont{sacabench construct},
which will run the specified algorithm on the given input file.
While the algorithm is running, its memory consumption is measured via the tudostat library\todo{Ist das relevant?}.
You can also enable checking of the resulting suffix array with a fast suffix array checker~\cite{saca:11} by
using the \termfont{-c} or \termfont{-q} flag.

After the algorithm is finished, you will find a JSON file containing detailed information about
the run of the SACA, seperated into SACA-specific phases.
This file can be converted to a plot on the tudostat website (see Figure \ref{tudostat_phases} as an example).

\subsection{Comparing multiple algorithms}

In order to compare different algorithms with each other, you can run a set of algorithms on a given input file.
This is achieved by using the \termfont{sacabench batch} command.
By default all included algorithms are run, but you can either deselect certain
algorithm with the \termfont{-{}-blacklist <saca name>} flag or run only certain
algorithms by using the \termfont{-{}-whitelist <saca name>} command.

The selected algorithms are run sequentially on the input text and their memory consumption
and construction times measured.
At the end a JSON file will be produced which contains the measured data.
We also supply tools to convert the JSON file into several types of plots, like bar plots, strong- and weak-scaling plots.
These plots can be used to compare the algorithms fairly.

\section{SACA Overview}

There are many SACAs that operate using different principles.
The most na\"ive SACA uses a general purpose sorting algorithm to sort the suffices of the input text.
Since a string comparison is $\mathcal O (n)$ in the worst-case, this would give $\mathcal O (n^2 \log n)$ runtime.
Even though this is a sub-optimal time bound,
there are several algorithms\footnote{e.g. Deep-Shallow, mSufSort, ...} in SACABench which don't improve on this
but rather use methods to speed up the real-world performance.
These methods can be classified into the categories \emph{inducing} and \emph{doubling}:
%
\paragraph{Inducing} %
There are different methods of inducing but they mostly operate by similar principles.
When the rank of a suffix $i$ (that is the position of $i$ in the SA) is known,
it is possible to deduce the rank of other suffixes $j$.

The easiest to understand usecase for this is when using buckets.
Recall that a bucket $B_{\sigma}$ is a region of the suffix
array which contains only and all the suffixes,
which start with the substring $\sigma$.
It is obvious that all the subbuckets $B_{\sigma\alpha}$ for
every $\alpha \in \Sigma$ are contained within $B_\sigma$.
It is possible to \emph{induce} the order of the $B_{\alpha\sigma}$ bucket,
if all Buckets $B_\sigma$ for every possible $\sigma \in \Sigma$ are already sorted (by whatever method),
since you know the regions of $B_\alpha$ that are the $B_{\alpha\sigma}$ Subbuckets.
You can then (for $\sigma \in \Sigma$) find the suffixes of $B_{\alpha\sigma}$ in $B_{\sigma}$,
subtract one of every index and write the found suffixes in-order to $B_{\alpha\sigma}$.
Since the suffixes of $B_{\alpha\sigma}$ are essentially the same as $B_\sigma$ but
with only one (the same) character added in front of them,
their relative ordering is the same as the suffixes in $B_\sigma$.
This method is used in e.g. Deep-Shallow~\cite{saca:4} and 
Bucket Pointer Refinement~\cite{saca:2}\todo{more sacas? correct refs?}.

Another method of induction relies on the property of L- and S-Type suffixes and
is most prominently used in the SAIS-Algorithm.
This algorihm is based on the sorting of all the LMS suffixes (by recursion)
and a Left-to-right-pass (to induce the L suffixes)
and a Right-to-left-pass (to induce the S suffixes)\todo{nachschlagen wir der sais ging}.
It can be shown that after these two passes the resulting suffix array is correct.

\paragraph{Doubling} Another fundamentally different approach to suffix sorting
aims to double the length of sorted suffixes in every iteration.
This is done by first sorting the suffixes by their first character only.
To then deduce the ordering of all the elements in the $B_\alpha$ bucket,
one can look at the relative ordering of the suffixes that start one position
after the to-be-sorted suffix:
their relative ordering decide the ordering of the original suffixes.
In the next iteration one can look at the suffixes that start two positions later in the text,
and so on.
After $\mathcal O(\log n)$ iterations (since we double the prefix size in every iteration),
all the suffixes are sorted.
This method is used by qsufsort~\cite{unknown}\todo{fix ref} and the
doubling/discarding algorithm originally developed for use with external memory~\cite{saca:11}.

\bigskip

There are also some recursive algorithms, which mostly operate on a shared principle:
%
\paragraph{Recursive} Some algorithms, such as DC3~\cite{xxx} and SAIS~\cite{xxx}\todo{ref?} require to sort a
partial set of suffixes as part of their task to sort the entire suffix array.
As they are able to do this by calling themselves with a different input, they are called \emph{recursive algorithms}.
DC3 sorts exactly $^2\!/\!_3$ of the suffixes by recursion, while SAIS sorts all the LMS suffices by recursion,
if their ordering cannot be decided by looking at their first character.
After this step, the ordering of the other suffixes can be induced.

    \caption{(partial) History of SACAs}
    \label{ea:fig:history}
\end{figure}

See Figure \ref{ea:fig:history} for a short summary of SACA history.
The different SACAs are divided into the three classes described above.
We now briefly explain the shown algorithms and their differences.

Prefix Doubling is a SACA which works purely by the above described method \emph{Doubling}.
In every iteration the SA is refined and double the amount of characters are considered for sorting.
This directly influenced qsufsort, which improved its performance~\cite{hermann?}.
BPR incorporated some ideas of inducing with prefix doubling and is therefore on the edge of those two paradigms.
Its inducing is based on the copy-technique by Seward~\cite{seward2000}\todo{right ref?}.
This technique is also used by Deep-Shallow, which uses string-sorting instead of prefix doubling.
It influenced divsufsort, which \todo{Olli? Adde hier mal shit}.
mSufSort is another inducing-SACA, but since it constructs the \emph{inverse suffix array} instead of the SA,
it's not derived from any other SACA.
SAIS/SADS take inducing one step further than DivSufSort and induce most suffixes after a recursion step.
This is also done by SACA-K and GSACA, which are both similar to SAIS, but add some optimizations
(SACA-K for example doesn't use any extra space).
The two other recursive SACAs are DC3 (which sorts $\frac{2}{3}$ of the suffixes in a recursion step)
and nzSufSort (which is similar to DC3 but improves on some aspects)\todo{nico? johannes? bitte ergänzen}.

\section{Optimization Strategies}

As with most programs, much of the performance of SACAs is dependent on efficiently implementing these algorithms.
We therefore used some practical optimizations to the descriptions of the algorithms to improve performance.
The following is an incomplete list of tricks one can use to do so.

\subsection{Different bit lengths for the suffix array}

We implemented our SACAs with an exchangable suffix array index type, that is a different bit length for the indices in the suffix array.
With our current implementation it is possible to use 32, 40, 48 and 64 bit for the suffix array elements.
Since our tool supports a different output encoding (32 or 64 bit), we can save memory during construction regardless of the desired output length.
Keep in mind that since the 40- and 48-bit types are not standardized, their performance is inferior to those of 32- and 64- bit types.
We measured an approximate 2.5x slowdown compared to the built-in number types.\todo{Nochmal richtig messen?}

\subsection{Cache-efficiency}

The most crucial part of optimizing a SACA is cache-efficiency, that is aiming for time-local and space-local memory access.
Since the SA is a pseudo-random mutation of numbers, the SA can't be written cache-efficiently.

\subsection{Wordpacking}

To maximize throughput, multiple characters of the input (8 bit each) can be processed as a whole by
interpreting them as integer numbers (64 bit, or even up to 512 bit by using vector operations).
This is done in multiple algorihms\todo{welche?} to improve performance.

\subsection{Binary vs. ternary comparison-based sort}

Since different applications require different algorithms, we implemented multiple versions of quicksort:
Two of them are introsort~\cite{Musser97} and ternary quicksort~\cite{ternary_quicksort}.
It has been shown that the binary sorting procedure is faster,
if there are no equal elements in the set to be sorted.\todo{Graph oder Messung?};
the ternary version is faster when there are~\cite{ternary_quicksort}.
We therefore chose the best option for the required use-case.

\section{Evaluation}



\section{Conclusion}

We introduced SACABench, an extensive framework for benchmarking and comparing suffix array construction algorithms.
It includes a large set of publicly available SACAs and simplifies the comparison of these with new SACAs.
The code is written in modern C++ and well documented and can therefore be helpful in understanding the algorithms.
We also include several parallel SACAs as well as parallel reference implementations.

In our evaluation we confirmed divsufsorts dominance on most of the tested texts.
