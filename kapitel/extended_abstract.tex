\section{Introduction}

The suffix array is a widely known text index, which can be used for various string operations, like full-text search~\cite{makinen} and construction of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)~\cite{BWT}.
While the efficient construction is still an active research area,
divsufsort~\cite{saca:5,saca:5:repo} is the empirically fastest suffix array construction algorithm (SACA) since 2008\todo{wann?},
even though it has a theoretical complexity of $\mathcal O (n \log n)$,
while there are a few $\mathcal O(n)$ algorithms available.
In the last year we (re-)implemented eleven SACAs~\cite{saca:3,saca:11,saca:5,saca:9,saca:1,saca:8,saca:4,saca:7,saca:10,saca:6,saca:2} in modern C++ in order to beat divsufsort from its throne,
and although our attempts were not successful,
we created a sophisticated and fully-fledged benchmark system for SACA algorithms, \emph{SACABench}, in the process.

In this paper we introduce SACABench and highlight its features,
as well as document some of the optimiziation strategies we used to implement the SACA algorithms.
